            <p>I had to use Figma to get my design up and running. If Figma didn’t exist, I probably wouldn’t have come
                up with this idea. I used the big 3 again—HTML, CSS, and JS. It was a bit tricky getting the fade in
                effect to work, but I persisted and got it done. Originally, I was only going to make specific elements
                fade in, but I realized I’m not quite there yet, so I went with this design instead.
