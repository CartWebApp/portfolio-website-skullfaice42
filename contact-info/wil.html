            <p>Once again, I used Figma to design this page originally. I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build what
                you see on the web. I had to learn how to make the email and LinkedIn links load one after the other. I
                had to persist in overcoming this challenge. It took about an hour to figure out how to get it working,
