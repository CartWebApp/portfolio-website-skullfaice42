            <p>I had to use multiple tools for the content of this page, such as Tinkercad and Figma. Tinkercad is a
                virtual environment that helps us determine whether our circuit is going to work or not, and Figma was
                used for designing the website. I also used GitHub to push my code. It was challenging getting the
                circuit to work, but I persisted and got it working with some time and assistance from friends.
